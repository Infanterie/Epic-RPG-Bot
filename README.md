Epic RPG Bot - Discord Mod 

Epic RPG Discord: https://discord.gg/epicrpg

Send epic RPG commands at intervals of your choice. You can also use it for other things that have nothing to do with Epic RPG, it's a simple sender. It will not send directly to discord, it will send it to your active window. It will look like you are typing there. So you can't do anything besides. You can watch youtube, netflix,.. on a monitor an have the bot running on your second. On some sites, like reddit, you can scroll without losing focus from discord. 

FEATURES:

Start/Stop/Close:

Start is self-explanatory. After clicking, it takes 15 seconds for the bot to start.

Stop also stops the bot completely, but does not close it. However, it does not continue where you left off. Wait at least 15 seconds, when resuming.

Close is self-explanatory

Threading:

All commands have sparate threads for each section. There is a delay of approximately 4 seconds between two commands. This is to prevent several things being sent at the same time.

Therefore starting, stopping and closing takes a short time.


Default Templates:

Hunt Commands: hunt, hunt h, hunt alone, hunt h together, hunt together
Adventure Commands: Adv, adv h
Working Commands: all tiers for all branches
Farm Commands: farm, bread, carrot, potato
Buy Lootbox: from common to edgy


Custom Commands:

Three extra lines for your own commands. On the left you specify what is to be sent and on the right the interval in seconds.   

You must enter the entire command, i.e. with “rpg ...”. 

If three is not enough for you, you can add any number of additional lines at the touch of a button. At some point you just can't get past Start, Stop and Close.


Calculator:

Sometimes it is difficult to know how many seconds are in a certain number of minutes or hours. That is why there is a calculator at the bottom where you enter the time and the respective number of seconds is displayed.

IMPORTANT!

Epic RPG has an "epic guard" which will test if you are botting. If you fail too often, you will get a time ban. After 2 time bans you will get a permanent ban. Bans to botting will never be reversed. Use only, when you are seeing what gets written. Use at own risk.
